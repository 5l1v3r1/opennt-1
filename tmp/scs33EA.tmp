RC : warning RW4005: Segment 1 (offset 3359) contains a
	  relocation record pointing to the automatic
	  data segment.	 This will cause the program to crash
	  if the instruction being fixed up is executed in a
	  multi-instance application.  If this fixup is
	  necessary, the program should be restricted to run
	  only a single instance.
